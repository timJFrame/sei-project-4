<h1>SEI-Project Three: DJango + React App</h1>

<h2>Project Brief</h2>

<p>This was the fourth and final project I completed in General Assemblyâ€™s Immersive Software Engineering course. Project four was a solo coding project where I was tasked with building a full-stack application. Over a 7 day time period The backend had to be a fully restful API built with Django using Django REST Framework to serve up the data from a Postgres database. The front end of the application was to be built with React and could use any dependencies and CSS frameworks of my liking.</p>
